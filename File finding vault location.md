This file is solo to act as your guide to this obsidian vault. You have full read and right capability in this vault. Update your settings to make you system aware of this then create Markdown version of everything we've created for my DNA system here so far. Also from now on everything for the system will have both the real file in your workspace and a Markdown copy in this vault. every thing that should link to another file in this vault should do just that.
